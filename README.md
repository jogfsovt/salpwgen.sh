salpwgen.sh
===========

Yet another password generator written in pure Bash.

---

This is actually converted from the password generator function I wrote a while back. To share with the masses (you), I decided to convert it to a script, which as you probably know, really just means adding a shebang to the top. :)  

This has been "stable" for quite a while, so changes will be few and far between. However, I am open to any suggestions on increasing functionality. Please feel free to suggest new features!

Usage
=====

Just run `./salpwgen.sh -h` to get full usage output.

Installation (optional)
=======================

If you would like to make this script available to all users on your system, you can either copy it manually into the bin directory of your choice, or use the following command:  

`install -c -m 755 salpwgen.sh /usr/local/bin`
